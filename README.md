# angular-trap-all

**angular-trap-all** disallows tabbing out of a specified area. It's useful when implementing modal dialogs to prevent the user from interacting with what's behind a modal mask by simply tabbing out of the dialog.

This is similar to [**angular-tab-trap**](http://myplanet.github.io/angular-tab-trap/), but a lot better.
It works for all accessible form elements inside a modal dialog, including **select** tag.

# Download
