# angular-trap-all

**angular-trap-all** disallows tabbing out of a specified area. It's useful when implementing modal dialogs to prevent the user from interacting with what's behind a modal mask by simply tabbing out of the dialog.

This module has been inspired from **angular-tab-trap**,but it works even if the modal dialog contains form elements other than just input tags, like select tags or any other accessible elements.
